This is Debdroid/Debian 11 Source Code, some files on `/dev/` couldn't be added as im making this on my android phone.

You are free to modify this kernel-less OS at your basis by forking it

Although i suggest to build this and including the `/dev` componets and remove `.vscode` folder along the way if you want (32Bit ARM only.) (There's No Raw (C++/C source here))
